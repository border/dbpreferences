Example database based preferences storage. 

Fixes two issues:
 * http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=14359
 * lack of support for multiple processes access to SharedPreferences

Quote from http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences.html
  Note: currently this class does not support use across multiple processes. This will be added later.
